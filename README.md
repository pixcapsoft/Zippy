## üöÄ What is Zippy?

**Zippy** is a lightweight, Git-inspired version control tool that stores your project versions as zip files. It‚Äôs perfect for simple backups, sharing, and versioning without the complexity of full-blown VCS systems.

- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **No server required:** All data is local, portable, and easy to share
- **.zippyignore:** Ignore files/folders just like .gitignore
- **Human-readable tags:** Use version tags like `v1.0`, `release-2024`, etc.
- **Easy restore:** Instantly restore any version or just a specific file/folder

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Simple CLI, easy to learn
- Staging area (like git add)
- Commit with message and tag
- List, diff, and restore versions
- Patch existing versions
- Status command shows what will be committed and what changed
- Cross-platform builds (Windows, Linux, macOS, 32/64 bit)

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

- Always use `zippy add` before `zippy commit` to stage files.
- Use meaningful version tags and commit messages.
- Regularly check `zippy status` to see what will be committed and what changed.
- Edit `.zippyignore` to avoid archiving unwanted files (logs, build artifacts, etc).
- You can restore a single file or folder from any version‚Äîgreat for quick rollbacks!
- Use `zippy patch` to add files to an existing version if needed.

**Q: Where are my versions stored?**

## üòÇ Why Zippy is (Definitely) Better Than Git

- **No merge conflicts!**
  - Because you‚Äôre the only one using it (probably).
- **No remote drama.**
  - No one can force-push to your repo but you!
- **No cryptic commands.**
  - You‚Äôll never have to Google 'how to undo git rebase' again.
- **No detached HEADs.**
  - Zippy doesn‚Äôt even know what that means.
- **No .git folder bloat.**
  - Just a neat `.zippy/` and some zips. Marie Kondo would approve.
- **Restore a single file in one command.**
  - No checkout gymnastics required.
- **No need to remember SHA hashes.**
  - Use human tags like `v1.0`, `final-final`, or `oh-god-why`.
- **No blame.**
  - Zippy is a judgment-free zone.
- **No pull requests.**
  - If you want to argue with yourself, that‚Äôs your business.
- **No 'git push --force'.**
  - Zippy believes in second chances (and third, and fourth...)

> **Disclaimer:** If you need to collaborate, branch, or work with a team, use Git. If you want to zip and chill, use Zippy!
